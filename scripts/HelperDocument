The consumption_train data is present in the data.frame format and needs conversion to a time series object.

When assessing predictability, try to determine if there is a consistent relationship between one data point and the next.

consumption data is 0 for surface in xsmall and xxsmall. We will replace 0 values by median of consumption in xsmall and xxsmall.

The time series observations are evenly spaced as the power consumption is recorded on hourly basis.

The time observation index is timestamp that is of the format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm: ss. 


## consumption_train ##
This data is the trainig dataset

## EDA
1. 228689 missing values for  consumption_train$temperature
2. Investigate and try to fix missing values

## Learning
I had a fair understanding of data types but now I need to be absolutely sure about
the data type. For instance, difference between as.integer and as.logical when
factor variables are involved. Came across this link: http://www.diegobarneche.com/2014-12-11-ufsc/lessons/01-intro_r/data-structures.html

###Questions:
1. What percentage of missing values are allowed? 
2. How to plot outliers?

META DATA OBSERVATIONS
The consumption is more during weekdays (Monday- Thursday), somewhat more on Friday and less on 
Weekends (Saturday to Sunday)



##### FEATURE ENGINEERING #####
Create Weekday column based on value of *day_is_day_off
The surface values need to be converted to columns
