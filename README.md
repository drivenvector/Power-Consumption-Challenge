Why LSTM? What is it?
I wanted to get hands on experience with Deep Learning and LSTM seemed like a possible solution for this problem as recurrent networks are quite well suited for forecasting of sequential data (time series in this case). LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Networks are advance version of recurrent neural networks with some additional features. In LSTM, the network is capable of learning and maintaining a memory overtime while showing gradual improvement. 

I tried running facebook's prophet model but ran into an error even after preprocessing the data and feeding it to the forecasting algorithm of prophet.
