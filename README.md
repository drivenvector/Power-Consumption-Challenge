# Power Consumption Challenge

This repo contains the code for the ML competition held at [drivendata.com](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/55/schneider-cold-start/) 


Why LSTM? What is it?
I wanted to get hands on experience with Deep Learning and LSTM seemed like a possible solution for this problem as recurrent networks are quite well suited for forecasting of sequential data (time series in this case). LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Networks are advance version of recurrent neural networks with some additional features. In LSTM, the network is capable of learning and maintaining a memory overtime while showing gradual improvement. 

I was in top 10% of the competition.
